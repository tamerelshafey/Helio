## 🚀 Project Status: High-Fidelity MVP Complete

The project has evolved from a basic listing site into a robust web application featuring advanced state management, dynamic routing, and a complete CRM/CMS administration system.

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Architecture

*   **Core:** React 19 (Vite), TypeScript.
*   **State Management:**
    *   **Server State:** TanStack Query v5 (Caching, Auto-refetching, Optimistic Updates).
    *   **Global Client State:** Zustand (Lightweight, persistent store for Auth & Favorites).
*   **Routing:** React Router v7 with Lazy Loading & Code Splitting.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with Dark/Light mode support.
*   **Forms & Validation:** 
    *   **React Hook Form** for performance.
    *   **Zod** for schema-based validation (`utils/validation.ts`).
    *   **Custom Dynamic Form Engine** configurable via JSON/Admin Panel.
*   **Localization:** Custom Context-based i18n system (AR/EN).
*   **Mock Backend:** Service-repository pattern simulating API calls with realistic delays (`/services`).

## 🧪 Key Implementation Details

*   **Dynamic Form Engine:** Located in `components/shared/DynamicForm.tsx`. It renders forms based on JSON configurations managed in the Admin Panel, allowing for flexible data collection strategies with Zod validation integrated via `utils/validation.ts`.
*   **Centralized Validation:**  `utils/validation.ts` holds regex patterns (e.g., Egyptian phone numbers), Zod schemas, and error messages, ensuring consistent validation logic across the app.
*   **Error Handling:** A global `ErrorBoundary` wraps the app to catch runtime errors, while `ErrorState` components handle granular API failures within widgets.
*   **Performance:** Heavy components and routes are lazy-loaded using `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to ensure fast initial load times (`LoadingFallback`).
